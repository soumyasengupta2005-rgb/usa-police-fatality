# usa-police-fatality
A data analysis project exploring patterns and trends in fatal police encounters across the United States. Using official datasets such as the US Census and the Washington Post Police Shooting data, this project examines demographic correlations, state-wise disparities, and time-based trends to uncover meaningful insights through graphics and plots
This project analyzes fatal police encounters across the United States using publicly available datasets. It combines US Census data and Washington Post Police Shooting records to explore how demographic, geographic, and temporal factors correlate with incidents of police-involved deaths.

Through data cleaning, merging, and visualization in Python, the project aims to provide insightful, unbiased perspectives on patterns of use of force and fatalities.

Datasets Used
Police Shootings Data: The Washington Post’s Fatal Force database (covers incidents since 2015).
US Census Data: Demographic information by state and population group.

Tools & Libraries
Python 3.14
Pandas — Data cleaning and manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn — Visualizations
NumPy — Statistical operations
Jupyter Notebook (for exploration and visualization)

Features
Cleans and merges multiple real-world datasets
Performs demographic and regional analysis
Visualizes race, age, gender, and state-wise patterns
Identifies statistical correlations and yearly trends

Example Insights
Which states report the highest number of police-related fatalities
Demographic distribution of victims (race, gender, and age)
Relationship between population density and shooting frequency
Yearly comparison of fatal encounters

Future Improvements
Add interactive dashboards (Plotly / Dash)
Incorporate socio-economic data for deeper correlations
Build predictive models using machine learning
